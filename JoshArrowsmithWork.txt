locate the edge between non hazard and hazard zone
reach it
place a marker
turn clockwise until the hazard zone covers the left half of the drones vision
go forward until the hazard half of the vision changes to be higher or lower
if higher
	place a marker
	turn to the right until the hazard side takes up 50% of the drones vision again
	once this is done continue to follow down the line
if lower
	place a marker
	turn to the left until the hazard side takes up 50% of the drones vision again
	once this is done continue to follow down the line

irrelevant past this point:

when/if the drone finds the first marker again
	fly back to hq
	if encounter a fast boi
		transfere the data to them and tell them to return to hq
when drone gets back to hq
	transfer data to server/firefighting team
after transfer
	give this data to any drones that return to hq
	get back to closest marker to hq to help out
	

maybe have all drones broadcast their current location to make locating one another simpler or have a function that requests
the location of all other drones so we can start effectively relaying info quickly
